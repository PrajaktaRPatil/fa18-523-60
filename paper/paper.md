### MongoDB

In today's era, NoSQL databases have developed an enormous potential to 
process the unstructured data efficiently. Modern information is 
complex, extensive, and may not have pre-existing relationships. With 
the advent of the advanced search engines, machine learning, and 
Artificial Intelligence, technology expectations to process, store, and 
analyze such data has grown tremendously [@www-upwork]. Today, NoSQL 
database engines such as MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra have successfully 
overcome the traditional relational database challenges such as 
scalability, performance, unstructured data growth, agile sprint cycles, 
and growing needs of processing data in real-time with minimal hardware 
processing power [@www-guru99]. The NoSQL databases are a new generation 
of engines that don't necessarily require SQL language and are sometimes 
also called "Not Only SQL" databases. However, most of them support 
various third-party open connectivity drivers that can map NoSQL queries 
to SQL's. It would be safe to say that although NoSQL databases are 
still far from replacing the relational databases, they are adding an 
immense value when used in hybrid IT environments in conjunction with 
relational databases, based on the application specific needs 
[@www-guru99]. Today, MongoDB is one of the leading NoSQL databases in 
the market. It is fully capable of handling dynamic changes; processing 
large volumes of structured and unstructured data; easily using 
object-oriented programming features; as well as distributed systems 
challenges[@www-mongodb]. At its core, MongoDB is an open source, 
cross-platform, document database mainly written in C++ language. Each 
database within Mongo environment contains collections which in turn 
contain documents. Collections and documents are analogous to tables and 
rows respectively to the relational databases. The document structure is 
in a key-value form which allows storing of complex data types composed 
out of field and value pairs. Documents are objects which correspond to 
native data types in many programming languages, hence a well defined, 
embedded document can help reduce expensive joins and improve query 
performance. Every document is uniquely identified by a "_id" field 
[@www-guru99]. MongoDB offers flexibility to write records that are 
not restricted by column types. The data storage approach is flexible as 
it allows one to store data as it grows and to fulfill varying needs of 
applications and/or users. It supports JSON like binary points known as 
BSON where data can be stored without specifying the type of data 
[@www-upwork]. Moreover, it can be distributed on multiple machines at a 
high speed; it includes a sharidng feature that partitions and spreads 
the data out across various servers. This makes MongoDB an excellent 
choice for cloud data processing. Its utilities can load high volumes of 
data at high speed which ultimately provides a greater flexibility and 
availability in a cloud-based environment [@www-upwork]. The dynamic 
schema structure within MongoDB allows easy testing of the small sprints 
in agile project management life cycles and research projects that 
require frequent changes to the data structure with minimal downtime. 
Contrary to this flexible process, modifying the data structure of 
relational databases can be a very tedious process[@www-upwork]. 
Similarly to the relational databases, the query performance can be 
improved by using indexing. MongoDB queries support regular expressions 
as well as range asks for specific fields that eliminate the need of 
returning entire documents [@www-guru99]. MongoDB collections do not 
enforce document structure like SQL databases which is a compelling 
feature. However, it is essential to keep in mind the needs of the 
applications. The data retrieval patterns, the frequency of data 
manipulation statements such as insert, updates, and deletes may embark 
the use of indexes or incorporating the sharding feature to improve 
query performance and efficiency of MongoDB environment [@www-guru99]. 
One of the significant difference between relational databases and NoSQL 
databases are joins. In the relational database, one can combine results 
from two or more tables using a common column, often called as key. The 
native table contains the primary key column while the referenced table 
contains a foreign key. This mechanism allows one to make changes in a 
single row instead of changing all rows in the referenced table, this 
action is referred to as normalization. MongoDB is a documented database 
and mainly contains denormalized data which means the data is repeated 
instead of indexed over a specific key. If the same data is required in 
more than one table, it needs to be repeated. This constraint has been 
eliminated in MongoDB's new version 3.2. The new release introduced a 
"$lookup" feature which more likely works as a left-outer-join. Lookups 
are restricted to aggregated functions which means that data usually 
need some type of filtering and grouping operations to be conducted 
beforehand. For this reason, joins in MongoDB require more complicated 
querying compared to the traditional relational database joins. Although 
at this time, "lookups" are still very far from replacing "joins", this 
is a prominent feature that can resolve some of the relational data 
challenges for MongoDB [@www-sitepoint]. When it comes to the technical 
elements of MongoDB, it posses a rich interface for importing and 
storage of external data in various formats. Using Mongo Import/Export 
tool one can easily transfer the contents from a JSON, CSV, or TSV files 
into a database. MongoDB supports CRUD(Create, read, update, delete) 
operations efficiently and has detailed documentation available on the 
website. It can also query the geospatial data, and it is capable of 
storing geospatial data in GeoJSON objects. Aggregation Operation of 
MongoDB process data records and returns computed results. MongoDB 
aggregation framework is modeled on the concept of data pipelines. Data 
security is the crucial aspect of enterprise infrastructure management 
and that is why MongoDB provides various security features such as 
authentication, access control, and encryption. It supports mechanisms 
such as SCRAM and LDAP and Kerberos authentication. The administrator 
can create role-based access control; roles can be predefined or custom. 
MongoDB can audit activities such as DDL, CRUD statements, 
authentication and authorization operations [@www-mongodbmanual]. In 
regards to the cloud technologies, MongoDB also offers fully automated 
cloud service called "Atlas" with competitive pricing options. Mongo 
Atlas Cloud interface offers interactive GUI for managing cloud 
resources and deploying applications quickly. The service is equipped 
with geographically distributed instances to ensure no single point 
failure. Also, a well-rounded performance monitoring interface allows 
users to promptly detect anomalies and generate index suggestions to 
optimize the performance and reliability of the database. Global 
technology leaders such as Google, Facebook, eBay, and Nokia are 
leveraging MongoDB and Atlas cloud services making MongoDB one of the 
most popular choices among the NoSQL databases [@www-mongomanual]. 


### PyMongo

MongoDB is an open source database which stores information as flexible
JSON-like documents. The documents can have any number, name, or hierarchy of
fields information within it. Storing information in a MongoDB document
is different than storing it in a relational database row data. MongoDB can
be used as a persistent, searchable Python dictionaries repository [@flask-pymongo].

Three top-level packages for interacting with MongoDB are available in PyMongo 
distribution contains. The bson is an implementation of the BSON format, while
Pymongo is a full-featured driver for MngoDB, and gridfs is a set of tools 
for working with the GridFS storage specification. PyMongo is the official 
driver published by the Mongo to work with Python. It is a Python distribution that
contains tools for working with MongoDB and is the recommended way to work with 
MongoDB from Python [@api-mongodb-com-api].

PyMongo supports MongoDB versions 2.6, 3.0, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6 and 4.0 [@github].
It contains the thread-safe features and provides a built-in connection 
pooling for threaded applications [@api.mongodb.com-FAQ]. PyMongo also 
supports asynchronous frameworks like Gevent, asyncio, Tornado, or Twisted. 
as well as mod_wsgi also [@api.mongodb.com-FAQ].

For representing dates and times in MongoDB documents, PyMongo uses 
datetime objects [@api-mongodb-com-api]. Since MongoDB assumes that dates 
and times are in UTC, one should ensure that dates and 
times written to the database reflect the UTC [@api-mongodb-datetimes].

Atlas is MongoDB, Inc.â€™s hosted MongoDB as a service offering. 
Pymango can be used to connect Atlas from python code. Connections 
to Atlas are secure, but also need TLS/SSL. For connections using TLS/SSL,
PyMongo may require third party dependencies as determined by the version of 
Python. With Python 3.3+, PyMongo and any TLS/SSL-related 
dependencies can be installed using the pip tls command [@api.mongodb.com-atlas].

Creating a MongoClient to the running mongod instance is the first step when 
working with PyMongo. A single instance of MongoDB can support multiple 
independent databases. When working with PyMongo, one accesses databases using 
attribute style access on the MongoClient instances. In PyMongo dictionaries are
used to represent documents [@api-mongodb-com-tutorial].


PyMongo can be installed or upgraded with a single pip command. The pip is the 
recommended way of installing PyMongo on all platforms. Specific PyMongo 
versions can also we obtained by using specific pip commands [@api-mongodb-com-installation]. 
Also, an easy_install from setuptools location (https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/)
can be used for installation and upgrade. There is another way to install Pymongo directly 
from the source. First, an install of the C extension dependencies is necessary before the 
latest GitHub source is checked and the driver from the resulting 
tree is installed [@api-mongodb-com-installation].


PyMongo has some dependencies as it supports only Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4+, 
PyPy, and PyPy3. The GSSAPI authentication requires pykerberos on Unix
or WinKerberos on Windows for installation.

The first step when working with PyMongo is to create a MongoClient to the 
running mongod instance [@api-mongodb-com-tutorial]. It will connect to the 
default host and port. Per user preference, the host and port can also be 
explicitly specified [@api-mongodb-com-tutorial]. 


One MongoDb instance can connect multiple independent databases. PyMongo 
uses an attribute style access on MongoClient instances to access databases.
If attribute style access does not work, instead a dictionary style access to 
connect should be used [@api-mongodb-com-tutorial].

There are many tools written for working with PyMongo. These tools give 
additional flavor to PyMongo. Below is the list for some of the tools.

1) **PyMODM** is an ORM-like framework on top of PyMongo. The PyMODM 
 provides simple, extensible functionality that can be leveraged by other 
 libraries to target platforms like Django. At the same time, PyMODM is 
 powerful enough to be used for developing applications on its own 
 [@api-mongodb-tools].

2) **Humongolus** is a lightweight ORM framework for Python and MongoDB. 
The name comes from the combination of MongoDB and Homunculus. 
Humongolus allows one to create models/schemas with robust validation 
[@api-mongodb-tools].

3) **Ming** (the Merciless) is a library that allows users to enforce 
schemas on a MongoDB database in their Python application. It was developed by 
SourceForge during their migration to MongoDB [@api-mongodb-tools].

4) **MongoEngine** is another ORM-like layer on top of PyMongo. It allows one 
to define schemas for documents and query collections using syntax inspired by 
the Django ORM [@api-mongodb-tools].

5) **uMongo** is a Python MongoDB ODM. Its inception comes from two needs: 
the lack of async ODM and the difficulty to do document(un)serialization
with existing ODMs. It works with multiple drivers: PyMongo, TxMongo, 
motor_asyncio, and mongomock [@api-mongodb-tools].

6) **Djongo** is a connector for using Django with MongoDB as the database backend.
The Django Admin GUI can be used to add and modify documents in MongoDB 
[@api-mongodb-tools]. 


7) **Django MongoDB Engine** is a MongoDB database backend for Django that 
completely integrates with its ORM [@api-mongodb-tools].

8) **mongodb_beaker** is a project to enable using MongoDB as a backend for 
beakerâ€™s caching / session system [@api-mongodb-tools].

9) **Log4Mongo** is a flexible Python logging handler that can store logs in 
MongoDB using normal and capped collections [@api-mongodb-tools].

10) **MongoLog** is a Python logging handler that stores logs in MongoDB using a 
capped collection [@api-mongodb-tools].

11) **c5t** is a content-management system using TurboGears and MongoDB 
[@api-mongodb-tools].

12) **rod.recipe.mongodb** is a ZC Buildout recipe for downloading and
 installing MongoDB [@api-mongodb-tools].

13) **repoze-what-plugins-mongodb** is a project working to support a plugin for
 using MongoDB as a backend for repoze.what [@api-mongodb-tools].

14) **mongobox** is a tool to run a sandboxed [@api-mongodb-tools] 
MongoDB instance from within a python app [@api-mongodb-tools].

15) **Flask-MongoAlchemy** add Flask support for MongoDB using MongoAlchemy 
[@api-mongodb-tools].

16) **Flask-MongoKit** is the Flask extension to better integrate
MongoKit into Flask [@api-mongodb-tools].

17) **Flask-PyMongo** is the bridges Flask and PyMongo [@api-mongodb-tools].
